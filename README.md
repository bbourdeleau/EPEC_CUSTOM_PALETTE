# EPEC_CUSTOM_PALETTE
palette plug in wordpress

This plug-in was made to get in favorite the colors used for the "explorateur du front-end" project.
To install this plug-in paste the files from the repo into the wp-content/plugin folder, 
except the .po and the .mo files witch goes in wp-content/language/plugin to translate the colors from english to french.
If you want to change the colors in favorite, do some PHP tricks by openning the .php file and change the hexadecimal values (#XXXXXX)
by the value you want, if you want some more colors just copy paste an "array(...)" and it's content and change the values to those you need.

thanks for using this plug-in, hope you'll enjoy it and please remember to don't rate and subscribe because this is just a test ;)
